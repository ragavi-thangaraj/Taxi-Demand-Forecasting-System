        "# depending on your chosen cloud provider (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Azure).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 1: Create a Virtual Machine (VM) Instance\n",
        "# - Log in to your cloud provider's console.\n",
        "# - Navigate to the Compute Engine (GCP), EC2 (AWS), or Virtual Machines (Azure) section.\n",
        "# - Click on \"Create Instance\", \"Launch Instance\", or \"+ Create\".\n",
        "# - Choose a descriptive name for your VM (e.g., \"taxi-demand-api\").\n",
        "# - Select a region and zone close to your users or data source.\n",
        "# - Choose a machine type. For a basic Flask app, a small to medium instance (e.g., e2-small/medium on GCP, t3.micro/small on AWS, B1s/B2s on Azure) should be sufficient to start. You can scale up later if needed. Ensure it has enough RAM (at least 1-2 GB recommended).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 2: Select a Suitable Operating System\n",
        "# - Under the \"Boot disk\" or \"Image\" section, choose a Linux distribution.\n",
        "# - Recommended options include:\n",
        "#   - Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) version (e.g., 20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS)\n",
        "#   - Debian (Stable version)\n",
        "# - Ensure the image is 64-bit.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 3: Configure Network Settings and Firewall\n",
        "# - In the network settings, configure the firewall rules.\n",
        "# - You need to allow incoming traffic on the port your Flask application will listen on. The default Flask port is 5000. If you use Gunicorn or uWSGI, they also typically run on a specific port (often 8000). You might eventually run your app behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache on port 80 or 443.\n",
        "# - For initial testing, create a firewall rule to allow TCP traffic on port 5000 (or your chosen port) from your IP address or a specific range. For broader access, you might open it to `0.0.0.0/0` (all IPs) but be cautious in production and consider stricter rules or a reverse proxy.\n",
        "# - Ensure SSH access (usually TCP port 22) is allowed so you can connect to the VM.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 4: Connect to the VM using SSH\n",
        "# - Once the VM is created and running, find its external IP address in the cloud console.\n",
        "# - Open a terminal on your local machine.\n",
        "# - Use the SSH command to connect. The command varies slightly depending on your OS and how you configured SSH keys or used the cloud provider's tools.\n",
        "# - General format: `ssh [username]@[external_ip_address]`\n",
        "#   - For Google Cloud, you can often use `gcloud compute ssh [instance-name] --zone=[zone]`\n",
        "#   - For AWS, you'll typically use `ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem [username]@[external_ip_address]` (default username might be `ubuntu` or `admin`)\n",
        "#   - For Azure, you might use `ssh [username]@[external_ip_address]` or use the Azure Cloud Shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 5: Update the Package List and Upgrade Existing Packages\n",
        "# - Once connected via SSH, run the following commands to update the package list and upgrade installed software:\n",
        "# - For Debian/Ubuntu:\n",
        "#   ```bash\n",
        "#   sudo apt update\n",
        "#   sudo apt upgrade -y\n",
        "#   ```\n",
        "# - For CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:\n",
        "#   ```bash\n",
        "#   sudo yum update -y\n",
        "#   # or for newer Fedora/CentOS Stream:\n",
        "#   # sudo dnf update -y\n",
        "#   ```\n",
        "# - It's also a good idea to install `git` if you plan to clone your project repository:\n",
        "#   ```bash\n",
        "#   sudo apt install git -y # For Debian/Ubuntu\n",
        "#   # or\n",

        "# Step 1: Access Your Cloud Provider's Console\n",
        "# - Log in to your cloud provider's web console.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 2: Navigate to Networking/Firewall Rules\n",
        "# - Find the section related to Networking, VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), or EC2 Security Groups (AWS).\n",
        "# - Look for \"Firewall rules\", \"Security groups\", or similar configurations associated with your VM instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 3: Identify or Create a Firewall Rule\n",
        "# - Find the firewall rule that applies to your VM. It might be a default rule or one created during VM setup.\n",

        "# Step 4: Configure the Firewall Rule to Allow Traffic to Your App Port\n",
        "# - **Protocol:** Select TCP.\n",

        "#   - For testing/demonstration: `0.0.0.0/0` (Allows access from any IP address on the internet). **Be cautious with this in production.**\n",
        "#   - For production: Restrict this to known IP addresses, IP ranges of your users, or the IP range of a load balancer or API gateway if you are using one.\n",

        "\n",

        "# - If you are using a Load Balancer or API Gateway, configure it to:\n",
        "#   - Listen for incoming traffic on a public-facing port (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).\n",
        "#   - Forward this traffic to the internal IP address of your VM and the port your application is running on (e.g., 5000).\n",
        "#   - Ensure the Load Balancer's security group/firewall allows traffic on the public-facing port, and your VM's security group/firewall allows traffic from the Load Balancer's IP range on the application port.\n",

        "# Step 6: Configure Operating System Firewall (if active)\n",
        "# - Connect to your VM via SSH.\n",
        "# - Check if an OS-level firewall like `ufw` (Ubuntu) or `firewalld` (CentOS/RHEL) is active.\n",
        "# - If active, add a rule to allow incoming TCP traffic on your application port (e.g., 5000).\n",
        "#   - For `ufw` (Ubuntu):\n",
        "#     ```bash\n",

        "#    - Ensure your VM instance or container host has a monitoring agent installed and configured to send system metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic) to your chosen monitoring tool. This is often done automatically with cloud provider images or agents.\n",
        "#    - Instrument your Flask application to collect application-specific metrics. This might involve:\n",
        "#        - Adding logging for request duration, error rates, and request counts.\n",
        "#        - Using libraries like `prometheus_client` (for Prometheus) or platform-specific SDKs to expose custom metrics like prediction latency, number of successful predictions, etc.\n",
        "#        - For a Gunicorn deployment, basic request metrics might be available via Gunicorn's logging or integration with monitoring agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Set Up Alerting:\n",
        "#    - In your monitoring tool's console, create alerting policies.\n",
        "#    - Define conditions based on the metrics collected:\n",
        "#        - High CPU utilization (e.g., > 80% for 15 minutes)\n",

        "#        - Define instance templates using the VM image where you deployed your application.\n",
        "#        - Configure scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization, load balancer traffic, or custom metrics. Set minimum and maximum numbers of instances.\n",
        "#    - For containerized deployments (e.g., on Kubernetes): Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA).\n",
        "#        - Define HPA resources that automatically scale the number of pods based on metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics from your application.\n",

        "#    - Configure your application and WSGI server (Gunicorn) to log to standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr).\n",
        "#    - Use a cloud-based centralized logging service (e.g., Cloud Logging on GCP, CloudWatch Logs on AWS, Azure Monitor Logs on Azure) to collect logs from your VMs or containers.\n",
        "#    - Ensure the logging agent on your VM/container is configured to capture stdout/stderr.\n",
        "#    - Structure your application logs (e.g., using JSON format) to include relevant information like timestamps, severity levels, request IDs, error messages, and context, making them easier to search and analyze.\n",

        "*   A `preprocess_test_for_api` function was implemented in `app.py` to replicate the data preprocessing steps used during model training, specifically addressing lagged demand features and weather data integration.\n",

        "*   Instructions were provided for choosing a WSGI server (Gunicorn was selected) and a deployment platform.\n",
        "*   Detailed instructions were given for setting up a virtual machine environment on a cloud platform, including creating the VM, selecting an OS, configuring networking/firewalls, connecting via SSH, and updating packages.\n",
        "*   Instructions were provided for transferring the necessary files (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `taxi_demand_model.pkl.gz`, and potentially `model_to_keep.pkl`) to the VM using `scp`.\n",

        "*   **Refine `app.py` for `model.to_keep`:** Confirm how `model.to_keep` is saved during the training phase. If it's not saved separately, modify the training script to save it (e.g., using `pickle`) so it can be loaded by `app.py`. Alternatively, if the entire `Model` class instance is saved, `app.py` should be updated to load the instance and access `instance.model` and `instance.to_keep`.\n"
